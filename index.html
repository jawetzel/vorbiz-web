              Vorbiz is a <strong>vendor‑facing</strong> app (not a customer
              POS) built for markets and pop‑ups. Create locations, add items
              with UPCs and variants, pin quick buttons, and scan labels to ring
              items in seconds. Reports summarize your day, date ranges, and
              sales tax by location.

        <h2>What the app does</h2>
        <div class="card p-4">
          <h3>Locations</h3>
          <p>
            Define where sales occur and which items are available there. Each
            location includes a <strong>name</strong>, <strong>address</strong>,
            and <strong>tax settings</strong>. Enable
            <strong>tax‑inclusive pricing</strong> if your listed price already
            includes tax; disable it to add tax on top.
          </p>

          <h3>Items</h3>
          <p>
            Create items with a <strong>name</strong>, <strong>price</strong>,
            and a <strong>UPC</strong> (12‑digit number). Vorbiz can generate a
            <strong>QR label</strong> from the UPC so it always scans back to
            the correct product. Toggle <strong>Quick Button</strong> for top
            sellers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add <strong>variants</strong> (e.g., 8oz / 12oz / 16oz) to keep your
            item list short. When an item has variants, the sale screen prompts
            you to pick the right option before adding it to the cart.
          </p>

          <h3>Sale screen</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Select the active location; any Quick Buttons appear for one‑tap
              adding.
            </li>
            <li>If an item has variants, you'll choose the option first.</li>
            <li>Built‑in label scanning adds items instantly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Managing sales</h3>
          <p>
            From the <strong>Sales List</strong>, you can update a sale's
            <strong>date</strong> or <strong>location</strong>. If line items or
            totals need changes, delete and recreate the sale with the correct
            details.
          </p>

          <h3>Reporting</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Day Report</strong> – all sales for a single day.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Date Range Report</strong> – summarized sales for any
              period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sales Tax Report</strong> – tax collected by location for
              easy filing.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="kbd">/</span> focuses the search bar</li>
            <li><span class="kbd">Enter</span> adds the top search result</li>

              You are solely responsible for all filings and submissions to tax

            <li>
              <strong>Restrictions.</strong> You may not copy, scrape, or

              proprietary notices.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>8. Service Availability &amp; Changes</h3>
          <p>
            We may add, change, or remove features at any time. We do not
            guarantee uptime, availability, or that the app is error-free.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Updates to Terms.</strong> We may update these Terms
            effective immediately upon posting in the app or site. Continued use
            constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Third-party dependencies.</strong> The service relies on
            external providers (Supabase, Google Play, RevenueCat, Sentry,
            Brevo). Outages or changes in those services may affect
            availability; we are not liable for those impacts.
          </p>
          <p><strong>No SLA.</strong> We do not provide service-level agreements.</p>
          <p>
            Support is provided via email on a best-effort basis with no

          </p>

          <h3>9. Data Retention &amp; Export</h3>
          <p><strong>User control.</strong> Vendors may export their own data at any time while their subscription is active.</p>
          <p><strong>Retention policy.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Active (“hot”) storage:</strong> 5 years of sales data is maintained and accessible through the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Archived (“cold”) storage:</strong> up to an additional 10 years of sales data is retained in secure offline/near-line backups.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Accessing archived data.</strong> Cold storage records are not
            accessible through the app interface. Vendors may request access by
            emailing <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>,
            and reasonable effort will be made to provide the requested data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Deletion.</strong> Upon account termination, data may be
            archived according to the retention schedule above, unless deletion
            is required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Not a legal record.</strong> Vorbiz retains data for
            convenience only. Vendors remain solely responsible for maintaining
            legally required records and producing them to authorities if
            requested.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Termination &amp; Suspension</h3>
          <p>

            fraud, or system abuse, or as required by law. You may stop using the
            app at any time; subscription cancellations must be handled through
            the Play Store.

          <h3>11. Disclaimers</h3>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>

            <li>The services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”</li>
            <li>
              We do not warrant accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a
              particular purpose.
            </li>
            <li>We do not warrant tax calculations, reports, or compliance outcomes.</li>
            <li>We do not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.</li>
            <li>
              Reports and exports are based on user-entered data and are not
              certified for tax, audit, or legal proceedings.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>No indirect damages.</strong> We are not liable for any
              indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages,
              including lost profits or revenue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data &amp; downtime.</strong> We are not liable for data loss
              (including device wipe, user error, sync failure, or provider
              outage) or for service interruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cap.</strong> Our total liability for any claim shall not
              exceed the amount you paid for the service in the one (1) month
              preceding the event giving rise to liability (or $0 if you are on
              the Free tier).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>13. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from claims
            arising out of your misuse of the services, your data submissions, or
            your violation of these Terms or applicable laws.
          </p>

          <h3>14. Governing Law; Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Governing law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the
              laws of the State of Louisiana, USA, without regard to
              conflict-of-laws rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Binding arbitration.</strong> Any dispute, claim, or
              controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
              services will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by a
              reputable arbitration provider (e.g., AAA under its Commercial
              Rules), conducted in Louisiana, in English, before a single
              arbitrator. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of
              competent jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Informal resolution first.</strong> Before filing, the
              party must send a written notice and allow 30 days to attempt
              informal resolution (contact:
              <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Small-claims option.</strong> Either party may bring a
              qualifying claim in small-claims court in Louisiana instead of
              arbitration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Class-action &amp; jury trial waiver.</strong> Disputes must
              be brought individually; class actions and jury trials are waived.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this Section is found
              unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>15. Export &amp; Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
            including export controls and sanctions. You represent that you are
            not located in a restricted jurisdiction or on a prohibited list.
          </p>

          <h3>16. Communications</h3>
          <p>
            We may contact you via the app or email (including
            <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>)
            regarding your account, service changes, or legal notices.
          </p>

          <h3>17. Miscellaneous</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Entire agreement.</strong> These Terms (plus the Privacy
              Policy) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the
              services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>No waiver.</strong> Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is unenforceable,
              the remainder remains in effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without
              our consent; we may assign them in connection with a merger, sale,
              or reorganization.

            <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
            <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Provide and improve our services (syncing, reporting, account
                management)

            </ul>

              We also use aggregated, de-identified data (information that cannot
              reasonably be linked back to you, your customers, or your
              transactions) to:
            </p>
            <ul>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We process vendor account, sales, and customer data to fulfill our
              contract with you (providing the Vorbiz service) and under our
              legitimate interests in improving reliability, securing the
              platform, and preventing fraud. These bases help us respond to
              data-protection requests in jurisdictions such as the EU and
              California.
            </p>
            <h3>3. What We Do Not Do</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information (PII),
                such as email addresses, phone numbers, EINs, or customer lists.
              </li>
              <li>
                We do not give third parties direct access to your vendor, customer,
                or sales records.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any external reporting is based only on aggregated and anonymized
                data.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. How We Share Information</h3>
            <p>
              We share data only with trusted service providers necessary for our
              operations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Supabase (authentication, database)</li>
              <li>RevenueCat (subscription and billing)</li>
              <li>Brevo (email communications)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              We may share aggregate, anonymized insights with third parties.
              These insights never include personal identifiers of vendors or
              customers.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Your Responsibilities as a Vendor</h3>
            <p>
              If you input customer data into Vorbiz, you are responsible for
              having permission or a lawful basis to collect and use that
              information. Under GDPR-style frameworks, you act as the data
              controller for your customers’ information, and Vorbiz acts as the
              data processor handling that information on your behalf.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>
              We retain sales and business data in line with our Terms of
              Service:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Hot storage (active data):</strong> accessible for 5
                years through the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cold storage (archived data):</strong> retained for up
                to an additional 10 years and available only upon request by
                emailing <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cloud server copy of your workspace is the authoritative
              record. Local device storage is a synced replica that is cleared
              when you log out. Backups follow the same retention window.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon account deletion, data may be archived according to this
              schedule unless law requires earlier deletion.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location (e.g., California, EU), you may have rights to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access, correct, or delete your data</li>
              <li>Export your data</li>
              <li>Restrict or object to certain processing</li>
              <li>
                Opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information (if
                applicable)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To exercise these rights, contact us at

            <h3>8. Security</h3>
            <p>
              We use industry-standard security measures to protect your
              information, including encryption in transit and access controls. No
              system is 100% secure, but we work to safeguard your data.
            </p>
            <h3>9. International Transfers</h3>
            <p>
              We may process and store information in the United States and in
