    <h2>Terms of Service – Vorbiz</h2>
    <div class="card p-4 legal">
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Provider:</strong> Joshua Wetzel, sole proprietorship (the
        “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Contact:</strong>
        <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>
      </p>

      <h3>1. What We Are</h3>
      <p>
        Vorbiz is a mobile-first sales tracking and reporting app for small
        vendors. It is intended for business use only (B2B). Some limited web
        views may be introduced in the future, but the web will not provide
        full app functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
      <p>
        By creating an account or using the app, you agree to these Terms of
        Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use Vorbiz.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Accounts &amp; Eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        Business use only. Accounts are intended for businesses; we do not
        target consumers or minors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Registration.</strong> Accounts are created via email +
          password only. You must provide accurate information and keep
          credentials confidential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Single role.</strong> All users have the same account type
          (no role hierarchy).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Subscriptions, Billing &amp; Refunds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tiers.</strong> Vorbiz offers a Free tier and paid Basic/Pro tiers.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Billing.</strong> Paid tiers are monthly subscriptions
          processed through Google Play and managed via RevenueCat.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Trials.</strong> No free trial is offered.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds follow Google Play’s policies.
          Any additional goodwill refunds are discretionary and not part of
          these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auto-renewal &amp; cancellation.</strong> Subscriptions
          auto-renew until canceled through the Play Store. Deleting the app
          does not cancel your subscription.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature scope.</strong> Features may differ by tier and may
          be added, removed, or reallocated at our discretion. The free tier
          has no guarantee of uptime, retention, or support.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Data &amp; Privacy</h3>
      <p><strong>Data we collect.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Vendor account info: name, email, hashed password, business name
        </li>
        <li>
          Sales records: transactions, line items, prices, taxes,
          timestamps, location IDs
        </li>
        <li>
          Customer data: planned for future releases (e.g., customer name,
          email, phone)
        </li>
        <li>
          Device &amp; analytics: device ID, app version, crash logs, usage
          analytics
        </li>
        <li>
          No payment card data is stored by us (billing is via
          Google/RevenueCat).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Authoritative copy.</strong> The server backup is the
        authoritative data. A local device copy is a replica to support
        offline use and is wiped on logout.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Third-party processors.</strong> We use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supabase (database/auth)</li>
        <li>Google Play (billing)</li>
        <li>RevenueCat (subscription management)</li>
        <li>Sentry (error logging/analytics)</li>
        <li>Brevo (email)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> Additional details appear in our
        separate Privacy Policy (incorporated by reference).
      </p>

      <h3>6. Your Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>You agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will not use Vorbiz for illegal sales or unlawful purposes.</li>
        <li>You will not submit fraudulent or misleading data or reports.</li>
        <li>
          You will not reverse engineer, tamper with, or scrape the app or
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not share accounts outside your organization without
          permission.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not use Vorbiz to sell restricted goods (including
          firearms, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, adult material, or any items
          prohibited by law) unless you are legally licensed.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are solely responsible for all filings and submissions to tax
          authorities. Vorbiz is not an accountant, tax preparer, or system
          of record—it is a helpful tool only.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Intellectual Property &amp; Your Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Our IP.</strong> All rights, title, and interest in the
          app, branding, software, and documentation are owned by Joshua
          Wetzel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your data.</strong> You retain ownership of your own sales
          data. You may export your data subject to technical availability
          and reasonable use limits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Restrictions.</strong> You may not copy, scrape, or
          repurpose the app’s code, design, or databases; you may not remove
          proprietary notices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Service Availability &amp; Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may add, change, or remove features at any time. We do not
        guarantee uptime, availability, or that the app is error-free.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Updates to Terms.</strong> We may update these Terms
        effective immediately upon posting in the app or site. Continued use
        constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-party dependencies.</strong> The service relies on
        external providers (Supabase, Google Play, RevenueCat, Sentry,
        Brevo). Outages or changes in those services may affect
        availability; we are not liable for those impacts.
      </p>
      <p><strong>No SLA.</strong> We do not provide service-level agreements.</p>
      <p>
        Support is provided via email on a best-effort basis with no
        guaranteed response time.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Data Retention &amp; Export</h3>
      <p><strong>User control.</strong> Vendors may export their own data at any time while their subscription is active.</p>
      <p><strong>Retention policy.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active (“hot”) storage:</strong> 5 years of sales data is maintained and accessible through the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Archived (“cold”) storage:</strong> up to an additional 10 years of sales data is retained in secure offline/near-line backups.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Accessing archived data.</strong> Cold storage records are not
        accessible through the app interface. Vendors may request access by
        emailing <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>,
        and reasonable effort will be made to provide the requested data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deletion.</strong> Upon account termination, data may be
        archived according to the retention schedule above, unless deletion
        is required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Not a legal record.</strong> Vorbiz retains data for
        convenience only. Vendors remain solely responsible for maintaining
        legally required records and producing them to authorities if
        requested.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Termination &amp; Suspension</h3>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access immediately for misuse,
        fraud, or system abuse, or as required by law. You may stop using the
        app at any time; subscription cancellations must be handled through
        the Play Store.
      </p>

      <h3>11. Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”</li>
        <li>
          We do not warrant accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a
          particular purpose.
        </li>
        <li>We do not warrant tax calculations, reports, or compliance outcomes.</li>
        <li>We do not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.</li>
        <li>
          Reports and exports are based on user-entered data and are not
          certified for tax, audit, or legal proceedings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No indirect damages.</strong> We are not liable for any
          indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages,
          including lost profits or revenue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data &amp; downtime.</strong> We are not liable for data loss
          (including device wipe, user error, sync failure, or provider
          outage) or for service interruptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cap.</strong> Our total liability for any claim shall not
          exceed the amount you paid for the service in the one (1) month
          preceding the event giving rise to liability (or $0 if you are on
          the Free tier).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>13. Indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from claims
        arising out of your misuse of the services, your data submissions, or
        your violation of these Terms or applicable laws.
      </p>

      <h3>14. Governing Law; Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Governing law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the
          laws of the State of Louisiana, USA, without regard to
          conflict-of-laws rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Binding arbitration.</strong> Any dispute, claim, or
          controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
          services will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by a
          reputable arbitration provider (e.g., AAA under its Commercial
          Rules), conducted in Louisiana, in English, before a single
          arbitrator. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of
          competent jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Informal resolution first.</strong> Before filing, the
          party must send a written notice and allow 30 days to attempt
          informal resolution (contact:
          <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Small-claims option.</strong> Either party may bring a
          qualifying claim in small-claims court in Louisiana instead of
          arbitration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Class-action &amp; jury trial waiver.</strong> Disputes must
          be brought individually; class actions and jury trials are waived.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this Section is found
          unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>15. Export &amp; Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
        including export controls and sanctions. You represent that you are
        not located in a restricted jurisdiction or on a prohibited list.
      </p>

      <h3>16. Communications</h3>
      <p>
        We may contact you via the app or email (including
        <a href="mailto:support@vorbiz.net">support@vorbiz.net</a>)
        regarding your account, service changes, or legal notices.
      </p>

      <h3>17. Miscellaneous</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Entire agreement.</strong> These Terms (plus the Privacy
          Policy) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the
          services.
        </li>
        <li><strong>No waiver.</strong> Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is unenforceable,
          the remainder remains in effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without
          our consent; we may assign them in connection with a merger, sale,
          or reorganization.
        </li>
      </ul>
